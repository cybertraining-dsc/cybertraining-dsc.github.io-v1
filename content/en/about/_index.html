The pervasive importance of computing and cyberinfrastructure is
broadly acknowledged in many areas of commercial, government, and
academic endeavors. This is reflected in Indiana University's (IU)
plan to build its new Intelligent Systems Engineering (ISE) program
with a strong computational and information technology basis and
situate it in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering
(SICE). As the curriculum needs to change and integrate modern
concepts and practices in a rapid fashion, students are changing as
well. Thus, we must not only support the rapid change of course
material but also support the learning modes of Generation Z.

This effot takes what we have learned from a four-year undergraduate
curriculum designed ab initio and taught so far to our first two
undergraduate classes, and invests it into developing active modules
that are customized for Cyberinfrastructure Contributors (CIC)
communities nucleated, built, and sustained via the dynamic use of
GitHub.

We rework carefully chosen subsets of our curriculum, including the
following topics: Cloud Computing, Big Data Applications, and
Analytics, Networking, High-Performance Computing, Artificial
Intelligence/Machine Learning, and Information Visualization. The
content will be offered online, in a modular format, and will reflect
the needs of today’s tech-savvy students by incorporating successful
community-building tools. We will support Generation Z CyberTraining
with all of the thriving approaches used by the Apache Software
Foundation, including meetups, workshops or hackathons and follow our
current approach that all student projects are stored in open GitHub
repositories and automatically made available for later learners and
educators. While the project primarily focuses on developing content
for training the CIC communities, we will offer a few modules for
domain scientists and engineers, e.g. the cyberinfrastructure users
(CIU) that exploit advanced CI methods for research in nanoengineering
and bioengineering. Appropriate modules will be made available on
portals such as nanoHUB where we reach a wider set of CIU
communities. This project is leveraging the very significant IU
investment in new faculty and new curricula to develop modules sourced
from these curricula and customized for CIC via the GitHub based
community model. All can contribute to the course improving the text,
the software and providing an amazing set of examples and we hope in
this project to show that we can build both learning and
sustainability communities by using the proven techniques of the
open-source software community.
