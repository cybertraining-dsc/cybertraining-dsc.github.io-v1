This page contains the list of the reports and projects.

Any report with a red tag will be returned without review even if the Status is set to final. E.g.

* ![](/images/failed-check.png) reports with the red check report tag will not 
  be reviewed or commented on.
* ![](/images/failed-status.png) reports with the red status tag will not 
  be reviewed for grading and returned without review. The Status: field in the 
  index.md file must be set only if your report is final and you like to get a 
  grade for it. Please set it only to final when you are absolutely sure your 
  project is done. BBe aware that reviewing your project may take time. 
  The earlier you make contributions even if it is not final the better for 
  your as we review the temporary commits in the GItHub repo.

  present will receive point deductions. The time to download must be included
