[Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12F779a9bwsxUaQ66cVZj5AzTpLLdMEUw/view?usp=sharing)

### Use Case 1-1 Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working

The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus definition, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data stakeholders to pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their processing and visualization requirements on the most suitable computing platforms and clusters while allowing value-added from big data service providers and flow of data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner.

Introduction (13:02)

{{< youtube "3oKdmuH0N3k" >}}

### Use Case 1-2 Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup

The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry, academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them into components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with each other according to their similarities and differences.
For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding the meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain applications, and diversified operational environments. For Taxonomies: Identify key actors with their roles and responsibilities from all stakeholders, categorize them into components and subcomponents based on their similarities and differences. In particular data, Science and Big Data terms are discussed.

Taxonomies (7:42)

### Use Case 1-3 Reference Architecture Subgroup
 
The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner. Results include a reference architecture with well-defined components and linkage as well as several exemplars.

Architecture (10:05)

{{< youtube "h4ylW0vztDw" >}}

### Use Case 1-4 Security and Privacy Subgroup

The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure reference
architecture to handle security and privacy issues across all
stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what standards
are available or under development, as well as identifies which key
organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten Big Data
Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security Alliance)
BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include Retail/Marketing, Modern
Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web Traffic Analysis, Healthcare,
Health Information Exchange, Genetic Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data
Sharing, Cyber-security, Government, Military and Education.

Security (9:51)

{{< youtube "dHrHk-GvruY" >}}

### Use Case 1-5 Technology Roadmap Subgroup


The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a good
gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption priorities
through an understanding of what standards are available or under
development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gathered input from
NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors' roles and
responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure reference
architecture; gain an understanding of what standards are available or
under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap analysis and
document the findings; identify what possible barriers may delay or
prevent the adoption of Big Data; and document vision and recommendations.


Technology (4:14)

{{< youtube "va0UCR5gMTA" >}}

### Use Case 1-6 Requirements and Use Case Subgroup


The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big Data
requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
*essence* of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.

### Use Case 1-7 Recent Updates of work of NIST Public Big Data Working Group

This video is an update of recent work in this area. The first slide of this short lesson discusses a new version of use case survey that had many improvements including tags to label key features (as discussed in slide deck 3) and merged in a significant set of security and privacy fields.  This came from the security and privacy working group described in lesson 4 of this slide deck. A link for this new use case form is 
https://bigdatawg.nist.gov/_uploadfiles/M0621_v2_7345181325.pdf
A recent December 2018 use case form for Astronomy’s Square Kilometer Array is at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CxqCISK4v9LMMmGox-PG1bLeaRcbAI4cDIlmcoRqbDs/edit?usp=sharing This uses a simplification of the official new form. 

The second (last) slide in update gives some useful on latest work.

## Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) Features of 51 Big Data Use Cases

This unit discusses the categories used to classify the 51 use-cases.
These categories include concepts used for parallelism and low and high
level computational structure. The first lesson is an introduction to
all categories and the further lessons give details of particular
categories.

Events; (Complex) Nodes in a Graph; Simple nodes as in a learning
network; Tweets, Blogs, Documents, Web Pages etc.; Files or data to be
backed up, moved or assigned metadata; Particles/cells/mesh points. Low
level computational types include PP (Pleasingly Parallel); MR
(MapReduce); MRStat; MRIter (iterative MapReduce); Graph; Fusion; MC
(Monte Carlo) and Streaming. High level computational types include
Classification; S/Q (Search and Query); Index; CF (Collaborative
Filtering); ML (Machine Learning); EGO (Large Scale Optimizations); EM
(Expectation maximization); GIS; HPC; Agents. Patterns include Classic
Database; NoSQL; Basic processing of data as in backup or metadata; GIS;

## Overview of NIST Big Data Public Working Group (NBD-PWG) The 10 Use Case Patterns

[Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rs2h7JTaTbqkZluigD7Wk_22kiaKuZ9s/view?usp=sharing)


In this last slide deck of the use cases unit, we will be focusing on 10 Use case patterns. This includes multi-user querying, real-time analytics, batch analytics, data movement from external data sources, interactive analysis, data visualization, ETL, data mining and orchestration of sequential and parallel data transformations. We go through the different ways the user and system interact in each case. The use case patterns are divided into 3 classes 1) initial examples 2) science data use case patterns and 3) remaining use case patterns.
