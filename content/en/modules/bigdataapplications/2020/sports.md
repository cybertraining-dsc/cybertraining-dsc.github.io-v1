# Sports with Big Data Applications

E534 2020 Big Data Applications and Analytics Sports Informatics Part I
Section Summary (Parts I, II, III): Sports sees significant
growth in analytics with pervasive statistics shifting to more
sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as game is built around
segments dominated by individuals where detailed (video/image)
achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are moving field
into big data arena. There are interesting relationships between the
economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at Wearables and
consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial visualization is
discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics, NFL Football,
Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing. 

## Part 1

Unit Summary (PartI): This unit discusses baseball starting
with the movie Moneyball and the 2002-2003 Oakland Athletics. Unlike
sports like basketball and soccer, most baseball action is built around
individuals often interacting in pairs. This is much easier to quantify
than many player phenomena in other sports. We discuss
Performance-Dollar relationship including new stadiums and
media/advertising. We look at classic baseball averages and
sophisticated measures like Wins Above Replacement.
