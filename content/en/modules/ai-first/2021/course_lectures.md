## Week 1


### Lecture

Our first meeting is 01:10P-02:25P on Tuesday

The zoom will be https://iu.zoom.us/my/gc.fox 

We will discuss how to interact with us. We can adjust the course
somewhat.

Also as lectures are/will be put on YouTube, we will go to one lecture per week -- we will choose day

The Syllabus has a general course description

Please communicate initially by email gcf@iu.edu

This first class discussed structure of class and agreed to have a section on deep learning technology.

We gave [Introductory Lecture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1esj3zXCswQm5n8kfF-BvRH2Ih6oqNpPQjq02UPzvIB0/edit?usp=sharing)

## Week 2

### Introduction

We gave an introductory lecture to optimization and deep learning. Unfortunately we didn't record the zoom serssion but we did make an offline recording with [slides IntroDLOpt: Introduction to Deep Learning and Optimization](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_aKqvFx0aObxpNsWA7IRPWgujMjrWBTa20dtUut6DuI/edit?usp=sharing) and YouTube
