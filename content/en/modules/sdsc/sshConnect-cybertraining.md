 We discuss how to run jupyter notebooks securely on comet.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Prerequisite

* Account on Comet

### 1.2. Effort

* 30 minutes

### 1.3. Topics covered

* Using Notebooks on Comet

## 2. SSH to Jupyter Notebooks on Comet 

We describe how to connection between the browser on your
local host (laptop) to a Jupyter service running on Comet over HTTP
and demonstrates why the connection is *not* secure.

![connection over HTTP](https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/notebooks-101/blob/master/Docs/images/jupyter-notebook-http.png?raw=true)

Note: google chrome has many local ports open in the range of 7713 - 7794. They are all connect to 80 or 443 on the other end.

## 3. Log onto comet.sdsc.edu

```
ssh -Y -l <username> <system name>.sdsc.edu
```

* create a test directory, or ```cd``` into one you have already
  created
* Clone the examples repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/notebook-examples.git
```


## 4. Launch a notebook on the login node

Run the jupyter command. Be sure to set the --ip to use the hostname,
which will appear in your URL :

```
[mthomas@comet-14-01:~] jupyter notebook  --no-browser --ip=`/bin/hostname`
```

You will see output similar to that shown below:

```
[I 08:06:32.961 NotebookApp] JupyterLab extension loaded from /home/mthomas/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/jupyterlab

    To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/mthomas/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/nbserver-6614-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://comet-14-01.sdsc.edu:8888/?token=6d7a48dda7cc1635d6d08f63aa1a696008fa89d8aa84ad2b
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=6d7a48dda7cc1635d6d08f63aa1a696008fa89d8aa84ad2b

```

Notice that the notebook URL is using HTTP, and when you connect the
browser on your local sysetm to this URL, the connection will _not_ be
secure. Note: it is against SDSC Comet policy to run applications on
the login nodes, and any applications being run will be killed by the
system admins. A better way is to run the jobs on an interactive node
or on a compute node using the batch queue (see the
[Comet User Guide](https://comet.sdsc.edu)), or on a compute node,
which is described in the next sections.

## 5. Obtain an interactive node

Jobs can be run on the cluster in `batch mode` or in `interactive
mode`. Batch jobs are performed remotely and without manual
intervention. Interactive mode enable you to run/compile your program
and environment setup on a compute node dedicated to you. To obtain an
interactive node, type:

```
srun --pty --nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=24 -p compute -t 02:00:00 --wait 0 /bin/bash
```

You will have to wait for your node to be allocated - which can take a
few or many minutes. You will see pending messages like the ones
below:

```
srun: job 24000544 queued and waiting for resources
srun: job 24000544 has been allocated resources
[mthomas@comet-18-29:~/hpctrain/python/PythonSeries]
```

You can also check the status of jobs in the queue system to get an
idea of how long you may need to wait.

Launch the Jupyter Notebook application.  Note: this application will
be running on comet, and you will be given a URL which will connect
your local web browser the interactive comet session:

```
jupyter notebook --no-browser --ip=`/bin/hostname`
```

This will give you an address which has localhost in it and a
token. Something like:

```
http://comet-14-0-4:8888/?token=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You can then paste it into your browser. You will see a running
Jupyter notebook and a listing of the notebooks in your
directory. From there everything should be working as a regular
notebook.  Note: This token is your auth so don't email/send it
around. It will go away when you stop the notebook.

To learn about Python, run the ```Python basics.ipynb``` notebook.  To
see an example of remote visualization, run the ```Matplotlib.ipynb```
notebook!


### 5.1 Access the node in your browser

Copy the the URL above into the browser running on your laptop.

### 5.2 Use your jupyterlab/jupyter notebook server!

Enjoy. Note that your notebook is unsecured.
