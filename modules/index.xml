&lt;p>This section covers 51 values of X and an overall study of Big data that
emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology)
study of Big data. The section covers the NIST Big Data Public Working
Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups:
Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup,
Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the
Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in this
process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source of
parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We
describe the key features of this classification.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="introduction-to-nist-big-data-public-working">Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from
industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a
consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and
technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology and
infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data stakeholders to
pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their processing and
visualization requirements on the most suitable computing platforms and
clusters while allowing value-added from big data service providers and
flow of data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="definitions-and-taxonomies-subgroup">Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big
Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and
vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry,
academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify
essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them into
components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with each
other according to their similarities and differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding the
meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain applications,
and diversified operational environments. For Taxonomies: Identify key
actors with their roles and responsibilities from all stakeholders,
categorize them into components and subcomponents based on their
similarities and differences. In particular data Science and Big Data
terms are discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach
to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic
for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable
Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics
tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and
cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and
the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure
manner. Results include a reference architecture with well defined
components and linkage as well as several exemplars.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="security-and-privacy-subgroup">Security and Privacy Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure reference
architecture to handle security and privacy issues across all
stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what standards
are available or under development, as well as identifies which key
organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten Big Data
Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security Alliance)
BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include Retail/Marketing, Modern
Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web Traffic Analysis, Healthcare,
Health Information Exchange, Genetic Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data
Sharing, Cyber-security, Government, Military and Education.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="technology-roadmap-subgroup">Technology Roadmap Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a good
gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption priorities
through an understanding of what standards are available or under
development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gather input from
NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors' roles and
responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure reference
architecture; gain understanding of what standards are available or
under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap analysis and
document the findings; identify what possible barriers may delay or
prevent adoption of Big Data; and document vision and recommendations.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="interfaces-subgroup">Interfaces Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This subgroup is working on the following document: &lt;em>NIST Big Data
Interoperability Framework: Volume 8, Reference Architecture Interface&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This document summarizes interfaces that are instrumental for the
interaction with Clouds, Containers, and HPC systems to manage virtual
clusters to support the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA).
The Representational State Transfer (REST) paradigm is used to define
these interfaces allowing easy integration and adoption by a wide
variety of frameworks. . This volume, Volume 8, uses the work performed
by the NBD-PWG to identify objects instrumental for the NIST Big Data
Reference Architecture (NBDRA) which is introduced in the NBDIF: Volume
6, Reference Architecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation was given at the &lt;em>2nd NIST Big Data Public Working
Group (NBD-PWG) Workshop&lt;/em> in Washington DC in June 2017. It explains our
thoughts on deriving automatically a reference architecture form the
Reference Architecture Interface specifications directly from the
document.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big Data
requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
&lt;em>essence&lt;/em> of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We describe the central role of Parallel computing in Clouds and Big
Data which is decomposed into lots of &lt;em>Little data&lt;/em> running in
individual cores. Many examples are given and it is stressed that issues
in parallel computing are seen in day to day life for communication,
synchronization, load balancing and decomposition. Cyberinfrastructure
for e-moreorlessanything or moreorlessanything-Informatics and the
basics of cloud computing are introduced. This includes virtualization
and the important &lt;em>as a Service&lt;/em> components and we go through several
different definitions of cloud computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gartner&amp;rsquo;s Technology Landscape includes hype cycle and priority matrix
and covers clouds and Big Data. Two simple examples of the value of
clouds for enterprise applications are given with a review of different
views as to nature of Cloud Computing. This IaaS (Infrastructure as a
Service) discussion is followed by PaaS and SaaS (Platform and Software
as a Service). Features in Grid and cloud computing and data are
treated. We summarize the 21 layers and almost 300 software packages in
the HPC-ABDS Software Stack explaining how they are used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud (Data Center) Architectures with physical setup, Green Computing
issues and software models are discussed followed by the Cloud Industry
stakeholders with a 2014 Gartner analysis of Cloud computing providers.
This is followed by applications on the cloud including data intensive
problems, comparison with high performance computing, science clouds and
the Internet of Things. Remarks on Security, Fault Tolerance and
Synchronicity issues in cloud follow. We describe the way users and data
interact with a cloud system. The Big Data Processing from an
application perspective with commercial examples including eBay
concludes section after a discussion of data system architectures.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We describe the central role of Parallel computing in Clouds and Big

&lt;h3 id="decomposition">Decomposition&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We describe why parallel computing is essential with Big Data and
distinguishes parallelism over users to that over the data in problem.
The general ideas behind data decomposition are given followed by a few
often whimsical examples dreamed up 30 years ago in the early heady days
of parallel computing. These include scientific simulations, defense
outside missile attack and computer chess. The basic problem of parallel
computing &amp;ndash; efficient coordination of separate tasks processing
different data parts &amp;ndash; is described with MPI and MapReduce as two
approaches. The challenges of data decomposition in irregular problems
is noted.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="parallel-computing-in-society">Parallel Computing in Society&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This lesson from the past notes that one can view society as an approach
to parallel linkage of people. The largest example given is that of the
construction of a long wall such as that (Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall) between
England and Scotland. Different approaches to parallelism are given with
formulae for the speed up and efficiency. The concepts of grain size
(size of problem tackled by an individual processor) and coordination
overhead are exemplified. This example also illustrates Amdahl&amp;rsquo;s law and
the relation between data and processor topology. The lesson concludes
with other examples from nature including collections of neurons (the
brain) and ants.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This lesson returns to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall and uses it to illustrate advanced
issues in parallel computing. First We describe the basic SPMD &amp;ndash; Single
Program Multiple Data &amp;ndash; model. Then irregular but homogeneous and
heterogeneous problems are discussed. Static and dynamic load balancing
is needed. Inner parallelism (as in vector instruction or the multiple
fingers of masons) and outer parallelism (typical data parallelism) are
demonstrated. Parallel I/O for Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall is followed by a slide
summarizing this quaint comparison between Big data parallelism and the
construction of a large wall.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We discuss Cyberinfrastructure for e-moreorlessanything or
moreorlessanything-Informatics and the basics of cloud computing. This
includes virtualization and the important &amp;lsquo;as a Service&amp;rsquo; components and
we go through several different definitions of cloud computing.Gartner&amp;rsquo;s
Technology Landscape includes hype cycle and priority matrix and covers
clouds and Big Data. The unit concludes with two simple examples of the
value of clouds for enterprise applications. Gartner also has specific
predictions for cloud computing growth areas.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Cloud Computing is introduced with an operational definition involving
virtualization and efficient large data centers that can rent computers
in an elastic fashion. The role of services is essential &amp;ndash; it underlies
capabilities being offered in the cloud. The four basic aaS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash;
Software (SaaS), Platform (Paas), Infrastructure (IaaS) and Network
(NaaS) &amp;ndash; are introduced with Research aaS and other capabilities (for
example Sensors aaS are discussed later) being built on top of these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This lesson gives Gartner&amp;rsquo;s projections around futures of cloud and Big
data. We start with a review of hype charts and then go into detailed
Gartner analyses of the Cloud and Big data areas. Big data itself is at
the top of the hype and by definition predictions of doom are emerging.
Before too much excitement sets in, note that spinach is above clouds
and Big data in Google trends.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We start with a discussion of Cloud (Data Center) Architectures with
physical setup, Green Computing issues and software models. We summarize
a 2014 Gartner analysis of Cloud computing providers. This is followed
by applications on the cloud including data intensive problems,
comparison with high performance computing, science clouds and the
Internet of Things. Remarks on Security, Fault Tolerance and
Synchronicity issues in cloud follow.&lt;/p>

and why clouds are the data center of the future are followed by
pictures and discussions of several data centers from Microsoft (mainly)
and Google. The role of containers is stressed as part of modular data
centers that trade scalability for fault tolerance. Sizes of cloud
centers and supercomputers are discussed as is &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; computing.&lt;/p>

faults but here clouds offer good support for recovery from faults. We
discuss both storage and program fault tolerance noting that parallel
computing is especially sensitive to faults as a fault in one task will
impact all other tasks in the parallel job.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recommender systems operate under the hood of such widely recognized
sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and Netflix where everything is a
recommendation. This involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor
and buyer whereby the buyer provides the vendor with information about
their preferences, while the vendor then offers recommendations tailored
to match their needs. Kaggle competitions h improve the success of the
Netflix and other recommender systems. Attention is paid to models that
are used to compare how changes to the systems affect their overall
performance. It is interesting that the humble ranking has become such a
dominant driver of the world&amp;rsquo;s economy. More examples of recommender
systems are given from Google News, Retail stores and in depth Yahoo!
covering the multi-faceted criteria used in deciding recommendations on
web sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The formulation of recommendations in terms of points in a space or bag
is given where bags of item properties, user properties, rankings and
users are useful. Detail is given on basic principles behind recommender
systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses similarities in
user rankings to predict their interests, and the Pearson correlation,
used to statistically quantify correlations between users viewed as
points in a space of items. Items are viewed as points in a space of
users in item-based collaborative filtering. The Cosine Similarity is
introduced, the difference between implicit and explicit ratings and the
k Nearest Neighbors algorithm. General features like the curse of
dimensionality in high dimensions are discussed. A simple Python k
Nearest Neighbor code and its application to an artificial data set in 3
dimensions is given. Results are visualized in Matplotlib in 2D and with
Plotviz in 3D. The concept of a training and a testing set are
introduced with training set pre labeled. Recommender system are used to
discuss clustering with k-means based clustering methods used and their
results examined in Plotviz. The original labelling is compared to
clustering results and extension to 28 clusters given. General issues in
clustering are discussed including local optima, the use of annealing to
avoid this and value of heuristic algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="s-recommender">Recommender Systems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We introduce Recommender systems as an optimization technology used in a
variety of applications and contexts online. They operate in the
background of such widely recognized sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and
Netflix where everything is a recommendation. This involves a symbiotic
relationship between vendor and buyer whereby the buyer provides the
vendor with information about their preferences, while the vendor then
offers recommendations tailored to match their needs, to the benefit of
both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There follows an exploration of the Kaggle competition site, other
recommender systems and Netflix, as well as competitions held to improve
the success of the Netflix recommender system. Finally attention is paid
to models that are used to compare how changes to the systems affect
their overall performance. It is interesting how the humble ranking has
become such a dominant driver of the world&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="recommender-systems-as-an-optimization-problem">Recommender Systems as an Optimization Problem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We define a set of general recommender systems as matching of items to
people or perhaps collections of items to collections of people where
items can be other people, products in a store, movies, jobs, events,
web pages etc. We present this as &amp;ldquo;yet another optimization problem&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="recommender-systems-introduction">Recommender Systems Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We give a general discussion of recommender systems and point out that
they are particularly valuable in long tail of tems (to be recommended)
that are not commonly known. We pose them as a rating system and relate
them to information retrieval rating systems. We can contrast
recommender systems based on user profile and context; the most familiar
collaborative filtering of others ranking; item properties; knowledge
and hybrid cases mixing some or all of these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We summarize some interesting points from a tutorial from Netflix for
whom &lt;em>everything is a recommendation&lt;/em>. Rankings are given in multiple
categories and categories that reflect user interests are especially
important. Criteria used include explicit user preferences, implicit
based on ratings and hybrid methods as well as freshness and diversity.
Netflix tries to explain the rationale of its recommendations. We give
some data on Netflix operations and some methods used in its recommender
systems. We describe the famous Netflix Kaggle competition to improve
its rating system. The analogy to maximizing click through rate is given
and the objectives of optimization are given.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Next we go through Netflix&amp;rsquo;s methodology in letting data speak for
itself in optimizing the recommender engine. An example iis given on
choosing self produced movies. A/B testing is discussed with examples
showing how testing does allow optimizing of sophisticated criteria.
This lesson is concluded by comments on Netflix technology and the full
spectrum of issues that are involved including user interface, data, AB
testing, systems and architectures. We comment on optimizing for a
household rather than optimizing for individuals in household.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We describe in greatest detail the methods used to optimize Yahoo web
sites. There are two lessons discussing general approach and a third
lesson examines a particular personalized Yahoo page with its different
components. We point out the different criteria that must be blended in
making decisions; these criteria include analysis of what user does
after a particular page is clicked; is the user satisfied and cannot
that we quantified by purchase decisions etc. We need to choose
Articles, ads, modules, movies, users, updates, etc to optimize metrics
such as relevance score, CTR, revenue, engagement.These lesson stress
that if though we have big data, the recommender data is sparse. We
discuss the approach that involves both batch (offline) and on-line
(real time) components.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Collaborative filtering is a core approach to recommender systems. There
is user-based and item-based collaborative filtering and here we discuss
the user-based case. Here similarities in user rankings allow one to
predict their interests, and typically this quantified by the Pearson
correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations between users.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We move on to item-based collaborative filtering where items are viewed

&lt;h3 id="item-based-collaborative-filtering">Item-based Collaborative Filtering&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We covered user-based collaborative filtering in the previous unit. Here
we start by discussing memory-based real time and model based offline
(batch) approaches. Now we look at item-based collaborative filtering
where items are viewed in the space of users and the cosine measure is
used to quantify distances. WE discuss optimizations and how batch
processing can help. We discuss different Likert ranking scales and
issues with new items that do not have a significant number of rankings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We define the k Nearest Neighbor algorithms and present the Python
software but do not use it. We give examples from Wikipedia and describe

there would be faster solution methods.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="recommender-systems---k-neighbors">Recommender Systems - K-Neighbors&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Next we provide some sample Python code for the k Nearest Neighbor and its application to
an artificial data set in 3 dimensions. Results are visualized in
Matplotlib in 2D and with Plotviz in 3D. The concept of training and
testing sets are introduced with training set pre-labelled.
This lesson is adapted from the Python k Nearest Neighbor code found on the
web associated with a book by Harrington on Machine Learning [??]. There are
two data sets. First we consider a set of 4 2D vectors divided into two
categories (clusters) and use k=3 Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify
3 test points. Second we consider a 3D dataset that has already been
classified and show how to normalize. In this lesson we just use
Matplotlib to give 2D plots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lesson goes through an example of using k NN classification
algorithm by dividing dataset into 2 subsets. One is training set with
initial classification; the other is test point to be classified by k=3
NN using training set. The code records fraction of points with a
different classification from that input. One can experiment with
different sizes of the two subsets. The Python implementation of
algorithm is analyzed in detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="plotviz">Plotviz&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The clustering methods are used and their results examined in
Plotviz. The original labelling is compared to clustering results and
extension to 28 clusters given. General issues in clustering are
discussed including local optima, the use of annealing to avoid this
and value of heuristic algorithms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This section starts by discussing general aspects of Big Data and Health
including data sizes, different areas including genomics, EBI, radiology
and the Quantified Self movement. We review current state of health care
and trends associated with it including increased use of Telemedicine.
We summarize an industry survey by GE and Accenture and an impressive
exemplar Cloud-based medicine system from Potsdam. We give some details
of big data in medicine. Some remarks on Cloud computing and Health
focus on security and privacy issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We survey an April 2013 McKinsey report on the Big Data revolution in US
health care; a Microsoft report in this area and a European Union report
on how Big Data will allow patient centered care in the future. Examples
are given of the Internet of Things, which will have great impact on
health including wearables. A study looks at 4 scenarios for healthcare
in 2032. Two are positive, one middle of the road and one negative. The
final topic is Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This lesson covers 9 aspects of the McKinsey report. These are the
convergence of multiple positive changes has created a tipping point for&lt;/p>
&lt;p>innovation; Primary data pools are at the heart of the big data
revolution in healthcare; Big data is changing the paradigm: these are
the value pathways; Applying early successes at scale could reduce US
healthcare costs by $300 billion to $450 billion; Most new big-data
applications target consumers and providers across pathways; Innovations
are weighted towards influencing individual decision-making levers; Big
data innovations use a range of public, acquired, and proprietary data&lt;/p>
&lt;p>types; Organizations implementing a big data transformation should
provide the leadership required for the associated cultural
transformation; Companies must develop a range of big data capabilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This lesson identifies data sources as Clinical Data, Pharma &amp;amp; Life
Science Data, Patient &amp;amp; Consumer Data, Claims &amp;amp; Cost Data and
Correlational Data. Three approaches are Live data feed, Advanced
analytics and Social analytics.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="genomics-proteomics-and-information-visualization">Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A study of an Azure application with an Excel frontend and a cloud BLAST
backend starts this lesson. This is followed by a big data analysis of
personal genomics and an analysis of a typical DNA sequencing analytics
pipeline. The Protein Sequence Universe is defined and used to motivate
Multi dimensional Scaling MDS. Sammon&amp;rsquo;s method is defined and its use
illustrated by a metagenomics example. Subtleties in use of MDS include
a monotonic mapping of the dissimilarity function. The application to
the COG Proteomics dataset is discussed. We note that the MDS approach
is related to the well known chisq method and some aspects of nonlinear
minimization of chisq (Least Squares) are discussed.&lt;/p>

(6:56)&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next we continue the discussion of the COG Protein Universe introduced
in the last lesson. It is shown how Proteomics clusters are clearly seen
in the Universe browser. This motivates a side remark on different
clustering methods applied to metagenomics. Then we discuss the
Generative Topographic Map GTM method that can be used in dimension
reduction when original data is in a metric space and is in this case
faster than MDS as GTM computational complexity scales like N not N
squared as seen in MDS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples are given of GTM including an application to topic models in
Information Retrieval. Indiana University has developed a deterministic
annealing improvement of GTM. 3 separate clusterings are projected for
visualization and show very different structure emphasizing the
importance of visualizing results of data analytics. The final slide
shows an application of MDS to generate and visualize phylogenetic
trees.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This Lecture is recorded in 8 parts and gives an introduction and motivation for the class. This and other lectures in class are divided into &amp;ldquo;bite-sized lessons&amp;rdquo; from 5 to 30 minutes in length; that&amp;rsquo;s why it has 8 parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lecture explains what students might gain from the class even if they end up with different types of jobs from data engineering, software engineering, data science or a business (application) expert. It stresses that we are well into a transformation that impacts industry research and the way life is lived. This transformation is centered on using the digital way with clouds, edge computing and deep learning giving the implementation. This &amp;ldquo;AI-Driven Digital Transformation&amp;rdquo; is as transformational as the Industrial Revolution in the past. We note that deep learning dominates most innovative AI replacing several traditional machine learning methods.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This lesson describes briefly the trends driving and consequent of the AI-Driven Digital Transformation. It discusses the organizational aspects of the class and notes the two driving trends are clouds and AI. Clouds are mature and a dominant presence. AI is still rapidly changing and we can expect further major changes. The edge (devices and associated local fog computing) has always been important but now more is being done there.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>What is Big Data, Data Analytics and X-Informatics?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start with X-Informatics and its rallying cry. The growing number of
jobs in data science is highlighted. The first unit offers a look at the
phenomenon described as the Data Deluge starting with its broad
features. Data science and the famous DIKW (Data to Information to
Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline are covered. Then more detail is given on
the flood of data from Internet and Industry applications with eBay and
General Electric discussed in most detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next unit, we continue the discussion of the data deluge with a
focus on scientific research. He takes a first peek at data from the
Large Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics and gives
some biology examples. He discusses the implication of data for the
scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive methodology
joining observation, theory and simulation as basic methods. Two broad
classes of data are the long tail of sciences: many users with
individually modest data adding up to a lot; and a myriad of Internet
connected devices &amp;ndash; the Internet of Things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We give an initial technical overview of cloud computing as pioneered by
companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new centers holding up
to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in terms of power
consumption and the environment are also touched upon, followed by a
list of the most critical features of Cloud computing with a comparison
to supercomputing. Features of the data deluge are discussed with a
salutary example where more data did better than more thought. Then
comes Data science and one part of it ~~ data analytics ~~ the large
algorithms that crunch the big data to give big wisdom. There are many
ways to describe data science and several are discussed to give a good
composite picture of this emerging field.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="what-is-x-informatics-and-its-motto">What is X-Informatics and its Motto&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This discusses trends that are driven by and accompany Big data. We give
some key terms including data, information, knowledge, wisdom, data
analytics and data science. We discuss how clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data can solve problems in X-Informatics.
We list many values of X you can defined in various activities across
the world.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="jobs">Jobs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Big data is especially important as there are some many related jobs. We
illustrate this for both cloud computing and data science from reports
by Microsoft and the McKinsey institute respectively. We show a plot
from LinkedIn showing rapid increase in the number of data science and
analytics jobs as a function of time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We look at some broad features of the data deluge starting with the size
of data in various areas especially in science research. We give
examples from real world of the importance of big data and illustrate
how it is integrated into an enterprise IT architecture. We give some
views as to what characterizes Big data and why data science is a
science that is needed to interpret all the data.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="data-science-process">Data Science: Process&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We stress the DIKW pipeline: Data becomes information that becomes
knowledge and then wisdom, policy and decisions. This pipeline is
illustrated with Google maps and we show how complex the ecosystem of
data, transformations (filters) and its derived forms is.&lt;/p>

considered later as physics Informatics and gives some biology examples.
He discusses the implication of data for the scientific method which is
changing with the data-intensive methodology joining observation, theory
and simulation as basic methods. We discuss the long tail of sciences;
many users with individually modest data adding up to a lot. The last
lesson emphasizes how everyday devices ~~ the Internet of Things ~~
are being used to create a wealth of data.&lt;/p>

more data did better than more thought. He introduces data science and
one part of it ~~ data analytics ~~ the large algorithms that crunch

&lt;p>This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and
evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson.
The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman
diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is
devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson
production with various forms of shape of signal and various background
and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple
principles of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they
are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces
Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in
natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random
Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial
and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We introduce Plotviz, a data visualization tool developed at Indiana
University to display 2 and 3 dimensional data. The motivation is that
the human eye is very good at pattern recognition and can &lt;em>see&lt;/em>
structure in data. Although most Big data is higher dimensional than 3,
all can be transformed by dimension reduction techniques to 3D. He gives
several examples to show how the software can be used and what kind of

&lt;p>The motivation of Plotviz is that the human eye is very good at pattern
recognition and can &lt;em>see&lt;/em> structure in data. Although most Big data is
higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by dimension
reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like clustering
and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis. The motivations
shows some Cheminformatics examples. The use of Plotviz is started in
slide 4 with a discussion of input file which is either a simple text or
more features (like colors) can be specified in a rich XML syntax.
Plotviz deals with points and their classification (clustering). Next
the protein sequence browser in 3D shows the basic structure of Plotviz
interface. The next two slides explain the core 3D and 2D manipulations
respectively. Note all files used in examples are available to students.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We use the K-means Python code in SciPy package to show real code for
clustering. After a simple example we generate 4 clusters of distinct
centers and various choice for sizes using Matplotlib tor visualization.
We show results can sometimes be incorrect and sometimes make different
choices among comparable solutions. We discuss the &lt;em>hill&lt;/em> between
different solutions and rationale for running K-means many times and
choosing best answer. Then we introduce MapReduce with the basic
architecture and a homely example. The discussion of advanced topics
includes an extension to Iterative MapReduce from Indiana University
called Twister and a generalized Map Collective model. Some measurements
of parallel performance are given. The SciPy K-means code is modified to
support a MapReduce execution style. This illustrates the key ideas of
mappers and reducers. With appropriate runtime this code would run in
parallel but here the &lt;em>parallel&lt;/em> maps run sequentially. This simple 2
map version can be generalized to scalable parallelism. Python is used
to Calculate PageRank from Web Linkage Matrix showing several different
formulations of the basic matrix equations to finding leading
eigenvector. The unit is concluded by a calculation of PageRank for
general web pages by extracting the secret from Google.&lt;/p>

sizes. We run through Python code with Matplotlib displays to divide
into 2-5 clusters. Then we discuss Python to generate 4 clusters of
varying sizes and centered at corners of a square in two dimensions. We
formally give the K means algorithm better than before and make
definition consistent with code in SciPy.&lt;/p>

independent K means and takes the best result &amp;ndash; an approach to avoiding
local minima. We allow this number of independent runs to be changed and
in particular set to 1 to generate more interesting erratic results. We
define changes in our new K means code that also has two measures of
quality allowed. The slides give many results of clustering into 2 4 6
and 8 clusters (there were only 4 real clusters). We show that the &lt;em>very
small&lt;/em> case has two very different solutions when clustered into two
clusters and use this to discuss functions with multiple minima and a
hill between them. The lesson has both discussion of already produced

&lt;p>The changing global climate is suspected to have long-term effects on
much of the world&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. Among the various effects, the rising
sea level will directly affect many people living in low-lying coastal
regions. While the ocean-s thermal expansion has been the dominant
contributor to rises in sea level, the potential contribution of
discharges from the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may
provide a more significant threat due to the unpredictable response to
the changing climate. The Radar-Informatics unit provides a glimpse in
the processes fueling global climate change and explains what methods
are used for ice data acquisitions and analysis.&lt;/p>

lesson details three mosaics of a changing Greenland ice sheet and
provides a concise overview to subsequent lessons by detailing
explaining how other remote sensing technologies, such as the radar, can
be used to sound the polar ice sheets and what we are doing with radar
images to extract knowledge to be incorporated into numerical models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We start with the Internet of Things IoT giving examples like monitors
of machine operation, QR codes, surveillance cameras, scientific
sensors, drones and self driving cars and more generally transportation
systems. We give examples of robots and drones. We introduce the
Industrial Internet of Things IIoT and summarize surveys and
expectations Industry wide. We give examples from General Electric.
Sensor clouds control the many small distributed devices of IoT and
IIoT. More detail is given for radar data gathered by sensors;
ubiquitous or smart cities and homes including U-Korea; and finally the
smart electric grid.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="internet-of-things">Internet of Things&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are predicted to be 24-50 Billion devices on the Internet by 2020;
these are typically some sort of sensor defined as any source or sink of
time series data. Sensors include smartphones, webcams, monitors of
machine operation, barcodes, surveillance cameras, scientific sensors
(especially in earth and environmental science), drones and self driving
cars and more generally transportation systems. The lesson gives many
examples of distributed sensors, which form a Grid that is controlled by
a cloud.&lt;/p>

CReSIS polar remote sensing project and then looks at the NSF Ocean
Observing Initiative and NASA&amp;rsquo;s MODIS or Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer instrument on a satellite.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Korea has an interesting positioning where it is first worldwide in
broadband access per capita, e-government, scientific literacy and total
working hours. However it is far down in measures like quality of life
and GDP. U-Korea aims to improve the latter by Pervasive computing,
everywhere, anytime i.e. by spreading sensors everywhere. The example of
a &amp;lsquo;High-Tech Utopia&amp;rsquo; New Songdo is given.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="smart-grid">Smart Grid&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The electrical Smart Grid aims to enhance USA&amp;rsquo;s aging electrical
infrastructure by pervasive deployment of sensors and the integration of
their measurement in a cloud or equivalent server infrastructure. A
variety of new instruments include smart meters, power monitors, and
measures of solar irradiance, wind speed, and temperature. One goal is
autonomous local power units where good use is made of waste heat.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sports sees significant growth in analytics with pervasive statistics
shifting to more sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as game
is built around segments dominated by individuals where detailed
(video/image) achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are
moving field into big data arena. There are interesting relationships
between the economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at
Wearables and consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial
visualization is discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics,
NFL Football, Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="basic-sabermetrics">Basic Sabermetrics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This unit discusses baseball starting with the movie Moneyball and the
2002-2003 Oakland Athletics. Unlike sports like basketball and soccer,
most baseball action is built around individuals often interacting in
pairs. This is much easier to quantify than many player phenomena in
other sports. We discuss Performance-Dollar relationship including new
stadiums and media/advertising. We look at classic baseball averages and
sophisticated measures like Wins Above Replacement.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This section starts with an overview of data mining and puts our study
of classification, clustering and exploration methods in context. We
examine the problem to be solved in web and text search and note the
relevance of history with libraries, catalogs and concordances. An
overview of web search is given describing the continued evolution of
search engines and the relation to the field of Information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The importance of recall, precision and diversity is discussed. The
important Bag of Words model is introduced and both Boolean queries and
the more general fuzzy indices. The important vector space model and
revisiting the Cosine Similarity as a distance in this bag follows. The
basic TF-IDF approach is dis cussed. Relevance is discussed with a
probabilistic model while the distinction between Bayesian and frequency
views of probability distribution completes this unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start with an overview of the different steps (data analytics) in web
search and then goes key steps in detail starting with document
preparation. An inverted index is described and then how it is prepared
for web search. The Boolean and Vector Space approach to query
processing follow. This is followed by Link Structure Analysis including
Hubs, Authorities and PageRank. The application of PageRank ideas as
reputation outside web search is covered. The web graph structure,
crawling it and issues in web advertising and search follow. The use of
clustering and topic models completes the section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="web-search-and-text-mining">Web Search and Text Mining&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The unit starts with the web with its size, shape (coming from the
mutual linkage of pages by URL&amp;rsquo;s) and universal power laws for number of
pages with particular number of URL&amp;rsquo;s linking out or in to page.
Information retrieval is introduced and compared to web search. A
comparison is given between semantic searches as in databases and the
full text search that is base of Web search. The origin of web search in
libraries, catalogs and concordances is summarized. DIKW &amp;ndash; Data
Information Knowledge Wisdom &amp;ndash; model for web search is discussed. Then
features of documents, collections and the important Bag of Words
representation. Queries are presented in context of an Information
Retrieval architecture. The method of judging quality of results
including recall, precision and diversity is described. A time line for
evolution of search engines is given.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boolean and Vector Space models for query including the cosine
similarity are introduced. Web Crawlers are discussed and then the steps
needed to analyze data from Web and produce a set of terms. Building and
accessing an inverted index is followed by the importance of term
specificity and how it is captured in TF-IDF. We note how frequencies
are converted into belief and relevance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>WebPlotViz is a browser based visualization tool developed at Indiana University.
This tool allows user to visualize 2D and 3D data points in the web browser.
WebPlotViz was developed as a succesor to the previous visualization tool PlotViz
which was a application which needed to be installed on your machine to be used.
You can find more information about PlotViz at the &lt;a href="plotviz.md">PlotViz Section&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The motivation of WebPlotViz is similar to PlotViz which is that the human eye
is very good at pattern recognition and can see structure in data. Although
most Big data is higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by
dimension reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like clustering
and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use">How to use&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to use WebPlotViz you need to host the application as a server, this
can be done on you local machine or a application server. The source code for
WebPlotViz can be found at the git hub repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/DSC-SPIDAL/WebPViz">WebPlotViz git Repo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However there is a online version that is hosted on Indiana university servers
that you can access and use. The online version is available at &lt;a href="https://spidal-gw.dsc.soic.indiana.edu/">WebPlotViz&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to use the services of WebPlotViz you would need to first create a
simple account by providing your email and a password. Once the account is
created you can login and upload files to WebPlotViz to be visualized.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="uploading-files-to-webplotviz">Uploading files to WebPlotViz&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While WebPlotViz does accept several file formats as inputs, we will look at the
most simple and easy to use format that users can use. Files are uploaded as
&amp;ldquo;.txt&amp;rdquo; files with the following structure. Each value is separated by a space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Index x_val y_val z_val cluster_id label&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example file:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>0 0.155117377 0.011486086 -0.078151964 1 l1&lt;br>
1 0.148366394 0.010782429 -0.076370584 2 l2&lt;br>
2 0.170597667 -0.025115137 -0.082946074 2 l2&lt;br>
3 0.136063907 -0.006670781 -0.082583441 3 l3&lt;br>
4 0.158259943 0.015187686 -0.073592601 5 l5&lt;br>
5 0.162483279 0.014387166 -0.085987414 5 l5&lt;br>
6 0.138651632 0.013358333 -0.062633719 5 l5&lt;br>
7 0.168020213 0.010742307 -0.090281011 5 l5&lt;br>
8 0.15810229 0.007551404 -0.083311109 4 l4&lt;br>
9 0.146878082 0.003858649 -0.071298345 4 l4&lt;br>
10 0.151487542 0.011896318 -0.074281645 4 l4&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have the data file properly formatted you can upload the file through
the WebPlotViz GUI. Once you login to your account you should see a Green
&amp;ldquo;Upload&amp;rdquo; button on the top left corner. Once you press it you would see a
form that would allow you to choose the file, provide a description and select a
group to which the file needs to be categorized into. If you do not want to
assign a group you can simply use the default group which is picked by default&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have uploaded the file the file should appear in the list of plots
under the heading &amp;ldquo;Artifacts&amp;rdquo;. Then you can click on the name or the &amp;ldquo;View&amp;rdquo;
link to view the plot. Clicking on &amp;ldquo;View&amp;rdquo; will directly take you to the full
view of the plot while clicking on the name will show and summary of the plot
with a smaller view of the plot (Plot controls are not available in the smaller
view). You can view how the sample dataset looks like after uploading at the
following link. @fig:webpviz-11 shows a screen shot of the plot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://spidal-gw.dsc.soic.indiana.edu/public/resultsets/2083856374">11 Points WebPlotViz plot&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../images/11_poitns_example.png" alt="11 Points Plot">{#fig:webpviz-11}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Users can apply colors to clusters manually or choose one of the color schemes
that are provided. All the controls for the clusters are made available once
your clock on the &amp;ldquo;Cluster List&amp;rdquo; button that is located on the bottom left
corner of the plot (Third button from the left). This will pop up a window that
will allow you to control all the settings of the clusters.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="features">Features&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>WebPlotViz has many features that allows the users to control and customize
the plots, Other than simple 2D/3D plots, WebPlotViz also supports time series
plots and Tree structures. The examples section will show case examples for each
of these. The data formats required for these plots are not covered here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../images/webplotviz_label.png" alt="WebPlotViz Features labeled">{#fig:webpviz-labled}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the features are labeled in @fig:webpviz-labled. Please note that @fig:webpviz-labled
shows an time series plot so the controls for playback shown in the figure are not
available in single plots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the features are descibed in the short video that is linked in the home
page of the hosted WebPlotViz site &lt;a href="https://spidal-gw.dsc.soic.indiana.edu/">WebPlotViz&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="examples">Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now we will take a look at a couple of examples that were visualized using
WebPlotViz.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fungi-gene-sequence-clustering-example">Fungi gene sequence clustering example&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The following example is a plot from clustering done on a set on fungi gene

&lt;p>Deploying enterprise applications has been always challenging. Without
consistent and reliable processes and practices, it would be
impossible to track and measure the deployment artifacts, which
code-files and configuration data have been deployed to what servers
and what level of unit and integration tests have been done among
various components of the enterprise applications. Deploying software
to cloud is much more complex, given &lt;em>Dev-Op&lt;/em> teams do not have
extensive access to the infrastructure and they are forced to follow
the guidelines and tools provided by the cloud companies. In recent
years, Continuous Integration (&lt;em>CI&lt;/em>) and Continuous Deployment
(&lt;em>CD&lt;/em>) are the &lt;em>Dev-Op&lt;/em> mantra for delivering software reliably
and consistently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While &lt;em>CI/CD&lt;/em> process is, as difficult as it gets, monitoring the
deployed applications is emerging as new challenge, especially, on an
infrastructure that is sort of virtual with VMs in combination with
containers. Continuous Monitoring (&lt;em>CM&lt;/em>) is somewhat new concept,
that has gaining rapid popularity and becoming integral part of the
overall &lt;em>Dev-Op&lt;/em> functionality. Based on where the software has been
deployed, continuous monitoring can be as simple as, monitoring the
behavior of the applications to as complex as, end-to-end visibility
across infrastructure, heart-beat and health-check of the deployed
applications along with dynamic scalability based on the usage of
these applications. To address this challenge, building robust
monitoring pipeline process, would be a necessity. Continuous
Monitoring aspects get much better control, if they are thought as
early as possible and bake them into the software during the
development. We can provide much better tracking and analyze metrics
much closer to the application needs, if these aspects are considered
very early into the process. Cloud companies aware of this necessity,
provide various &lt;em>Dev-Op&lt;/em> tools to make &lt;em>CI/CD&lt;/em> and continuous
monitoring as easy as possible. While, some of these tools and
aspects are provided by the cloud offerings, some of them must be
planned and planted into our software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At high level, we can think of a simple pipeline to achieve consistent
and scalable deployment process. &lt;em>CI/CD&lt;/em> and Continuous Monitoring
Pipeline:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Step 1 - Continuous Development - Plan, Code, Build and Test:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Planning, Coding, building the deployable artifacts - code,
configuration, database, etc. and let them go through the various
types of tests with all the dimensions - technical to business and
internal to external, as automated as possible. All these aspects
come under Continuous Development.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Step 2 - Continuous Improvement - Deploy, Operate and Monitor:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once deployed to production, how these applications get operated -
bug and health-checks, performance and scalability along with
various high monitoring - infrastructure and cold delays due to
on-demand VM/container instantiations by the cloud offerings due to
the nature of the dynamic scalability of the deployment and selected
hosting options. Making necessary adjustments to improve the overall
experience is essentially called Continuous Improvement.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The zoom will be &lt;a href="https://iu.zoom.us/my/gc.fox">https://iu.zoom.us/my/gc.fox&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will discuss how to interact with us. We can adjust the course
somewhat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also as lectures are/will be put on YouTube, we will go to one lecture per week &amp;ndash; we will choose day&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Syllabus has a general course description&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please communicate initially by email &lt;a href="mailto:gcf@iu.edu">gcf@iu.edu&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This first class discussed structure of class and agreed to have a section on deep learning technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We gave &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1esj3zXCswQm5n8kfF-BvRH2Ih6oqNpPQjq02UPzvIB0/edit?usp=sharing">Introductory Lecture&lt;/a>

&lt;h1 id="assignment-4">Assignment 4&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the fourth assignment, you will be working on (see @sec:534-week5)
lecture videos. Objectives are as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Summarize what you have understood. (1 page)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select a subtopic that you are interested in and research on the
current trends (0.5 page)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suggest ideas that could improve the existing work (imaginations and
possibilities) (0.5 page)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Summarize a specific video segment in the video lectures. To do this
you need to follow these guidelines. Mention the video lecture name
and section identification number. And also specify which range of
minutes you have focused on the specific video lecture (2 pages).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>For this assignment we expect a 4 page document. You can use a single
column format for this document. Make sure you write exactly 4 pages.
For your research section make sure you add citations to the sections
that you are going to refer. If you have issues in how to do citations
you can reach a TA to learn how to do that. We will try to include some
chapters on how to do this in our handbook. Submissions are in pdf
format only.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This unit has four lectures (slide=decks). The survey is 6 years old but the illustrative scope of Big Data Applications is still valid and has no better alternative. The problems and use of clouds has not changed. There has been algorithmic advances (deep earning) in some cases. The lectures are&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Overview of NIST Process&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>The 51 Use cases divided into groups&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Common features of the 51 Use Cases&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>10 Patterns of data &amp;ndash; computer &amp;ndash; user interaction seen in Big Data Applications&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is an overview of these lectures below. The use case overview slides recorded here are available as &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/104ORUVOwFV23c-GSYvvLWaiVyCXwGDV1Ah5k2kTB4_U/edit?usp=sharing">Google Slides&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="use-case-1-1-introduction-to-nist-big-data-public-working-group">Use Case 1-1 Introduction to NIST Big Data Public Working Group&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus definition, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data stakeholders to pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their processing and visualization requirements on the most suitable computing platforms and clusters while allowing value-added from big data service providers and flow of data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h3 id="use-case-1-2-definitions-and-taxonomies-subgroup">Use Case 1-2 Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry, academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them into components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with each other according to their similarities and differences.
For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding the meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain applications, and diversified operational environments. For Taxonomies: Identify key actors with their roles and responsibilities from all stakeholders, categorize them into components and subcomponents based on their similarities and differences. In particular data, Science and Big Data terms are discussed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taxonomies (7:42)&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="use-case-1-3-reference-architecture-subgroup">Use Case 1-3 Reference Architecture Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner. Results include a reference architecture with well-defined components and linkage as well as several exemplars.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="use-case-1-4-security-and-privacy-subgroup">Use Case 1-4 Security and Privacy Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure reference architecture to handle security and privacy issues across all stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what standards are available or under development, as well as identifies which key organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten Big Data Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security Alliance) BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include Retail/Marketing, Modern Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web Traffic Analysis, Healthcare, Health Information Exchange, Genetic Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data Sharing, Cyber-security, Government, Military and Education.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="use-case-1-5-technology-roadmap-subgroup">Use Case 1-5 Technology Roadmap Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a good gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption priorities through an understanding of what standards are available or under development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gathered input from NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors' roles and responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure reference architecture; gain an understanding of what standards are available or under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap analysis and document the findings; identify what possible barriers may delay or prevent the adoption of Big Data; and document vision and recommendations.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="use-case-1-6-requirements-and-use-case-subgroup">Use Case 1-6 Requirements and Use Case Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big Data requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and understanding various use cases from diversified application domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the &lt;em>essence&lt;/em> of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements systemization are discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This video is an update of recent work in this area. The first slide of this short lesson discusses a new version of use case survey that had many improvements including tags to label key features (as discussed in slide deck 3) and merged in a significant set of security and privacy fields. This came from the security and privacy working group described in lesson 4 of this slide deck. A link for this new use case form is

&lt;p>In this last slide deck of the use cases unit, we will be focusing on 10 Use case patterns. This includes multi-user querying, real-time analytics, batch analytics, data movement from external data sources, interactive analysis, data visualization, ETL, data mining and orchestration of sequential and parallel data transformations. We go through the different ways the user and system interact in each case. The use case patterns are divided into 3 classes 1) initial examples 2) science data use case patterns and 3) remaining use case patterns.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="e534-2020-big-data-applications-and-analytics-discovery-of-higgs-boson">E534 2020 Big Data Applications and Analytics Discovery of Higgs Boson&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Summary: This section of the class is devoted to a particular Physics experiment but uses this to discuss so-called counting experiments. Here one observes “events” that occur randomly in time and one studies the properties of the events; in particular are the events collection of subatomic particles coming from the decay of particles from a “Higgs Boson” produced in high energy accelerator collisions. The four video lecture sets (Parts I II III IV) start by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the experiments suggesting the existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson production with various forms of the shape of the signal and various backgrounds and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple principles of statistics are introduced with an explanation as to why they are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they have seen so often in natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The Central Limit Theorem concludes the discussion.&lt;/p>

&lt;hr>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../images/learning.png" alt=""> &lt;strong>Learning Objectives&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Introduction to IaC&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How IaC is related to DevOps&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How IaC differs from Configuration Management Tools, and how is it
related&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Listing of IaC Tools&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;hr>
&lt;h2 id="introduction-to-iac">Introduction to IaC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IaC(Infrastructure as Code) is the ability of code to generate, maintain
and destroy application infrastructure like server, storage and
networking, without requiring manual changes. State of the
infrastructure is maintained in files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud architectures, and containers have forced usage of IaC, as the
amount of elements to manage at each layer are just too many. It is
impractical to keep track with the traditional method of raising tickets
and having someone do it for you. Scaling demands, elasticity during odd
hours, usage-based-billing all require provisioning, managing and
destroying infrastructure much more dynamically.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the book “Amazon Web Services in Action” by Wittig [1], using a
script or a declarative description has the following advantages&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Consistent usage&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dependencies are handled&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Replicable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Customizable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Testable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Can figure out updated state&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Minimizes human failure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Documentation for your infrastructure&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Sometimes IaC tools are also called Orchestration tools, but that label
is not as accurate, and often misleading.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-iac-is-related-to-devops">How IaC is related to DevOps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>DevOps has the following key practices&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Automated Infrastructure&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Automated Configuration Management, including Security&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Shared version control between Dev and Ops&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Continuous Build - Integrate - Test - Deploy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Continuous Monitoring and Observability&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The first practice - Automated Infrastructure can be fulfilled by IaC
tools. By having the code for IaC and Configuration Management in the
same code repository as application code ensures adhering to the
practice of shared version control.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typically, the workflow of the DevOps team includes running
Configuration Management tool scripts after running IaC tools, for
configurations, security, connectivity, and initializations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-iac-tools-differs-from-configuration-management-tools-and-how-it-is-related">How IaC tools differs from Configuration Management Tools, and how it is related&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are 4 broad categories of such tools [2], there are&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ad hoc scripts: Any shell, Python, Perl, Lua scripts that are
written&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configuration management tools: Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Server templating tools: Docker, Packer, Vagrant&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Server provisioning tools: Terraform, Heat, CloudFormation, Cloud
Deployment Manager, Azure Resource Manager&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Configuration Management tools make use of scripts to achieve a state.
IaC tools maintain state and metadata created in the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the big difference is the state achieved by running procedural
code or scripts may be different from state when it was created because&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ordering of the scripts determines the state. If the order changes,
state will differ. Also, issues like waiting time required for
resources to be created, modified or destroyed have to be correctly
dealt with.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Version changes in procedural code are inevitabale, and will lead to
a different state.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Chef and Ansible are more procedural, while Terraform, CloudFormation,
SaltStack, Puppet and Heat are more declarative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IaC or declarative tools do suffer from inflexibility related to
expressive scripting language.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="listing-of-iac-tools">Listing of IaC Tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IaC tools that are cloud specific are&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Amazon AWS - AWS CloudFormation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Google Cloud - Cloud Deployment Manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Microsoft Azure - Azure Resource Manager&lt;/li>
&lt;li>OpenStack - Heat&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Terraform is not a cloud specific tool, and is multi-vendor. It has got
good support for all the clouds, however, Terraform scripts are not
portable across clouds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="advantages-of-iac">Advantages of IaC&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>IaC solves the problem of &lt;em>environment drift&lt;/em>, that used to lead to the
infamous “but it works on my machine” kind of errors that are difficult
to trace. According to &lt;span class="citeproc-not-found"
data-reference-id="WhatisIaC002">&lt;strong>???&lt;/strong>&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>IaC guarantees Idempotence – known/predictable end state –
irrespective of starting state. Idempotency is achieved by either
automatically configuring an existing target or by discarding the
existing target and recreating a fresh environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="further-reading">Further Reading&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Please see books and resources like the “Terraform Up and Running” [2]
for more real-world advice on IaC, structuring Terraform code and good
deployment practices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A good resource for IaC is the book “Infrastructure as Code” [3].&lt;/p>

Part I (Unit 8) Section Units 9-11 Summary: This section starts by
describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the
experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of
authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is
followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is devoted
to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson production
with various forms of shape of signal and various background and with
various event totals. Then random variables and some simple principles
of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they are
relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces Gaussian
(normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in natural
phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random Numbers with
their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial and
Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>E534 2019 Big Data Applications and Analytics Discovery of Higgs Boson:
Big Data Higgs Unit 11: Looking for Higgs Particles Part IV: Random Numbers,
Distributions and Central Limit Theorem
Section Units 9-11 Summary: This section starts by describing the
LHC accelerator at CERN and evidence found by the experiments suggesting
existence of a Higgs Boson. The huge number of authors on a paper,
remarks on histograms and Feynman diagrams is followed by an accelerator
picture gallery. The next unit is devoted to Python experiments looking
at histograms of Higgs Boson production with various forms of shape of
signal and various background and with various event totals. Then random
variables and some simple principles of statistics are introduced with
explanation as to why they are relevant to Physics counting experiments.
The unit introduces Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they
seen so often in natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given.
Random Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of
Binomial and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods.
The Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.
Big Data Higgs Unit 11: Looking for Higgs Particles Part IV: Random Numbers,
Distributions and Central Limit Theorem
Unit Overview: Geoffrey discusses Random Numbers with their Generators

&lt;h1 id="assignment-6">Assignment 6&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the sixth assignment, you will be working on (see @sec:534-week7)
lecture videos. Objectives are as follows.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Summarize what you have understood. (1 page)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Select a subtopic that you are interested in and research on the
current trends (0.5 page)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Suggest ideas that could improve the existing work (imaginations and
possibilities) (0.5 page)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Summarize a specific video segment in the video lectures. To do this
you need to follow these guidelines. Mention the video lecture name
and section identification number. And also specify which range of
minutes you have focused on the specific video lecture (2 pages).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pick a sport you like and show case how it can be used with Big Data
in order to improve the game (1 page). Use techniques used in the
lecture videos and mention which lecture video refers to this
technique.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>For this assignment we expect a 5-page document. You can use a single
column format for this document. Make sure you write exactly 5pages. For
your research section make sure you add citations to the sections that
you are going to refer. If you have issues in how to do citations you
can reach a TA to learn how to do that. We will try to include some
chapters on how to do this in our handbook. Submissions are in pdf
format only.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>|Exercise MNIST_V1.1.0: Find out what is a dense layer?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple model can be initiated by using an &lt;strong>Sequential&lt;/strong> instance in Keras.
For this instance we add a single layer.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Dense Layer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Activation Layer (Softmax is the activation function)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Dense layer and the layer followed by it is fully connected.
For instance the number of hidden units used here is 64
and the following layer is a dense layer followed by an activation
layer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A keras model need to be compiled before it can be used to train
the model. In the compile function, you can provide the optimization
that you want to add, metrics you expect and the type of loss function
you need to use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we use the adam optimizer, a famous optimizer used in neural networks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Exercise MNIST_V1.3.0: Find 3 other optimizers used on neural
networks.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The loss funtion we have used is the categorical_crossentropy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Exercise MNIST_V1.4.0: Find other loss functions provided in keras.
Your answer can limit to 1 or more.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the model is compiled, then the fit function is called upon passing the number of epochs,
traing data and batch size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The batch size determines the number of elements used per minibatch in optimizing the function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note: Change the number of epochs, batch size and see what happens.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This programme can be defined as a hello world programme in deep
learning. Objective of this exercise is not to teach you the depths of
deep learning. But to teach you basic concepts that may need to design a
simple network to solve a problem. Before running the whole code, read
all the instructions before a code section. Solve all the problems noted
in bold text with Exercise keyword (Exercise MNIST_V1.0 - MNIST_V1.6).
Write your answers and submit a PDF by following the &lt;strong>Assignment 5&lt;/strong>.
Include codes or observations you made on those sections.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="assignment-7">Assignment 7&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>For a Complete Project&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project must contain the following details;&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The idea of the project,&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be a novel idea. But a novel idea will carry more
weight towards a very higher grade. If you&amp;rsquo;re trying to replicate an
existing idea. Need to provide the original source you&amp;rsquo;re
referring. If it is a github project, need to reference it and
showcase what you have done to improve it or what changes you made in
applying the same idea to solve a different problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a). For a deep learning project, if you are using an existing model, you need to explain how did you use the same model to solve the problem suggested by you.
b). If you planned to improve the existing model, explain the suggested improvements.
c). If you are just using an existing model and solving an existing problem, you need to do an extensive benchmark. This kind of project carries lesser marks than a project like a) or b)&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Benchmark&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>No need to use a very large dataset. You can use the Google Colab and
train your network with a smaller dataset. Think of a smaller dataset
like MNIST. UCI Machine Learning Repository is a very good place to
find such a dataset. &lt;a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php&lt;/a> (Links
to an external site.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Get CPU, GPU, TPU Benchmarks. This can be something similar to what we did with our first deep learning tutorial.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Final Report&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The report must include diagrams or flowcharts describing the
idea. Benchmark results in graphs, not in tables. Use IEEE Template
to write the document. Latex or Word is your choice. But submit a PDF
file only. Template:
&lt;a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html&lt;/a> (Links to
an external site.)&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Submission Include,&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>IPython Notebook (must run the whole process, training, testing, benchmark, etc in Google Colab)
Providing Colab link is acceptable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The report in PDF Format&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is the expected structure of your project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the first phase, you need to submit the project proposal by Nov
10th. This must include the idea of the project with approximate
details that you try to include in the project. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to
claim the final result, it is just a proposal. Add a flowchart or
diagrams to explain your idea. Use a maximum of 2 pages to include
your content. There is no extension for this submission. If you
cannot make it by Nov 10th, you need to inform the professor and
decide the way you plan to finish the class.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyone who fails to submit this by the deadline will fail to complete the course.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a Term Paper&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a graduate student, by doing a term paper, the maximum possible grade is going to be an A-.
This rule doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to undergraduate students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a term paper, the minimum content of 8 pages and a maximum of 10 pages must include using any of the templates
given in project report writing section. (&lt;a href="https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html">https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html&lt;/a> (Links to an external site.))&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So when you are writing the proposal, you need to select an area in deep learning applications, trends or innovations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the area is sorted. Write a two-page proposal on what you will be including in the paper. This can be a rough
estimation of what you will be writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When writing the paper,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You will be reading online blogs, papers, articles, etc, so you will
be trying to understand concepts and write the paper. In this process
make sure not to copy and paste from online sources. If we find such
an activity, your paper will not be accepted. Do references properly
and do paraphrasing when needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keep these in mind, before you propose the idea that you want to
write. The term paper must include a minimum of 15 references which
includes articles, blogs or papers that you have read. You need to
reference them in the write-up. So be cautious in deciding the idea
for the proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Submission date is Nov 10th and there will be no extensions for
this. If you cannot make it by this date, you need to discuss with the
professor to decide the way you want to finish the class. Reach us via
office hours or class meetings to sort out any issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Special Note on Team Projects&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each member must submit the report. The common section must be
Abstract, Introduction, Overall process, results, etc. Each
contributor must write a section on his or her contribution to the
project. This content must be the additional 50% of the report. For
instance, if the paper size is 8 pages for an individual project,
another 4 pages explaining each member&amp;rsquo;s contribution must be added
(for the two-person project). If there are 4 members the additional
pages must be 8 pages. 2 additional pages per author. If results and
methods involve your contribution, clearly state it as a subsection,
Author&amp;rsquo;s Contribution.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Modules: Mobility (Industry)</title><link>/modules/ai-first/2021/mobility/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/modules/ai-first/2021/mobility/</guid><description>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Industry being transformed by a) Autonomy (AI) and b) Electric power&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>General Motors (employees: 225,000 in 2016 to around 180,000 in 2018) finds it hard to compete with Tesla (42000 employees)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Market value GM was half the market value of Tesla at the start of 2020 but is now just 11% October 2020&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GM purchased Cruise to compete&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Over the last 3 years, electrical power has gone from interesting to “bound to happen”; Tesla’s happy customers probably contribute to this&lt;/li>

&lt;h1 id="sports-with-big-data-applications-sec534-week7">Sports with Big Data Applications {#sec:534-week7}&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>E534 2019 Big Data Applications and Analytics Sports Informatics Part I
(Unit 32) Section Summary (Parts I, II, III): Sports sees significant
growth in analytics with pervasive statistics shifting to more
sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as game is built around
segments dominated by individuals where detailed (video/image)
achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are moving field
into big data arena. There are interesting relationships between the
economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at Wearables and
consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial visualization is
discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics, NFL Football,
Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="unit-32">Unit 32&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Unit Summary (PartI, Unit 32): This unit discusses baseball starting
with the movie Moneyball and the 2002-2003 Oakland Athletics. Unlike
sports like basketball and soccer, most baseball action is built around
individuals often interacting in pairs. This is much easier to quantify
than many player phenomena in other sports. We discuss
Performance-Dollar relationship including new stadiums and

&lt;p>E534 2020 Big Data Applications and Analytics Sports Informatics Part I
Section Summary (Parts I, II, III): Sports sees significant
growth in analytics with pervasive statistics shifting to more
sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as game is built around
segments dominated by individuals where detailed (video/image)
achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are moving field
into big data arena. There are interesting relationships between the
economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at Wearables and

&lt;h2 id="part-1">Part 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Unit Summary (PartI): This unit discusses baseball starting
with the movie Moneyball and the 2002-2003 Oakland Athletics. Unlike
sports like basketball and soccer, most baseball action is built around
individuals often interacting in pairs. This is much easier to quantify
than many player phenomena in other sports. We discuss
Performance-Dollar relationship including new stadiums and
media/advertising. We look at classic baseball averages and
sophisticated measures like Wins Above Replacement.&lt;/p>
