&lt;p>This section covers 51 values of X and an overall study of Big data that
emerged from a NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology)
study of Big data. The section covers the NIST Big Data Public Working
Group (NBD-PWG) Process and summarizes the work of five subgroups:
Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup, Reference Architecture Subgroup,
Security and Privacy Subgroup, Technology Roadmap Subgroup and the
Requirements andUse Case Subgroup. 51 use cases collected in this
process are briefly discussed with a classification of the source of
parallelism and the high and low level computational structure. We
describe the key features of this classification.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus of the (NBD-PWG) is to form a community of interest from
industry, academia, and government, with the goal of developing a
consensus definitions, taxonomies, secure reference architectures, and
technology roadmap. The aim is to create vendor-neutral, technology and
infrastructure agnostic deliverables to enable big data stakeholders to
pick-and-choose best analytics tools for their processing and
visualization requirements on the most suitable computing platforms and
clusters while allowing value-added from big data service providers and
flow of data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure manner.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="definitions-and-taxonomies-subgroup">Definitions and Taxonomies Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to gain a better understanding of the principles of Big
Data. It is important to develop a consensus-based common language and
vocabulary terms used in Big Data across stakeholders from industry,
academia, and government. In addition, it is also critical to identify
essential actors with roles and responsibility, and subdivide them into
components and sub-components on how they interact/ relate with each
other according to their similarities and differences.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Definitions: Compile terms used from all stakeholders regarding the
meaning of Big Data from various standard bodies, domain applications,
and diversified operational environments. For Taxonomies: Identify key
actors with their roles and responsibilities from all stakeholders,
categorize them into components and subcomponents based on their
similarities and differences. In particular data Science and Big Data
terms are discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus-based approach
to orchestrate vendor-neutral, technology and infrastructure agnostic
for analytics tools and computing environments. The goal is to enable
Big Data stakeholders to pick-and-choose technology-agnostic analytics
tools for processing and visualization in any computing platform and
cluster while allowing value-added from Big Data service providers and
the flow of the data between the stakeholders in a cohesive and secure
manner. Results include a reference architecture with well defined
components and linkage as well as several exemplars.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="security-and-privacy-subgroup">Security and Privacy Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus secure reference
architecture to handle security and privacy issues across all
stakeholders. This includes gaining an understanding of what standards
are available or under development, as well as identifies which key
organizations are working on these standards. The Top Ten Big Data
Security and Privacy Challenges from the CSA (Cloud Security Alliance)
BDWG are studied. Specialized use cases include Retail/Marketing, Modern
Day Consumerism, Nielsen Homescan, Web Traffic Analysis, Healthcare,
Health Information Exchange, Genetic Privacy, Pharma Clinical Trial Data
Sharing, Cyber-security, Government, Military and Education.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="technology-roadmap-subgroup">Technology Roadmap Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus vision with
recommendations on how Big Data should move forward by performing a good
gap analysis through the materials gathered from all other NBD
subgroups. This includes setting standardization and adoption priorities
through an understanding of what standards are available or under
development as part of the recommendations. Tasks are gather input from
NBD subgroups and study the taxonomies for the actors' roles and
responsibility, use cases and requirements, and secure reference
architecture; gain understanding of what standards are available or
under development for Big Data; perform a thorough gap analysis and
document the findings; identify what possible barriers may delay or
prevent adoption of Big Data; and document vision and recommendations.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="interfaces-subgroup">Interfaces Subgroup&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This subgroup is working on the following document: &lt;em>NIST Big Data
Interoperability Framework: Volume 8, Reference Architecture Interface&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This document summarizes interfaces that are instrumental for the
interaction with Clouds, Containers, and HPC systems to manage virtual
clusters to support the NIST Big Data Reference Architecture (NBDRA).
The Representational State Transfer (REST) paradigm is used to define
these interfaces allowing easy integration and adoption by a wide
variety of frameworks. . This volume, Volume 8, uses the work performed
by the NBD-PWG to identify objects instrumental for the NIST Big Data
Reference Architecture (NBDRA) which is introduced in the NBDIF: Volume
6, Reference Architecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation was given at the &lt;em>2nd NIST Big Data Public Working
Group (NBD-PWG) Workshop&lt;/em> in Washington DC in June 2017. It explains our
thoughts on deriving automatically a reference architecture form the
Reference Architecture Interface specifications directly from the
document.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The focus is to form a community of interest from industry, academia,
and government, with the goal of developing a consensus list of Big Data
requirements across all stakeholders. This includes gathering and
understanding various use cases from diversified application
domains.Tasks are gather use case input from all stakeholders; derive
Big Data requirements from each use case; analyze/prioritize a list of
challenging general requirements that may delay or prevent adoption of
Big Data deployment; develop a set of general patterns capturing the
&lt;em>essence&lt;/em> of use cases (not done yet) and work with Reference
Architecture to validate requirements and reference architecture by
explicitly implementing some patterns based on use cases. The progress
of gathering use cases (discussed in next two units) and requirements
systemization are discussed.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We describe the central role of Parallel computing in Clouds and Big
Data which is decomposed into lots of &lt;em>Little data&lt;/em> running in
individual cores. Many examples are given and it is stressed that issues
in parallel computing are seen in day to day life for communication,
synchronization, load balancing and decomposition. Cyberinfrastructure
for e-moreorlessanything or moreorlessanything-Informatics and the
basics of cloud computing are introduced. This includes virtualization
and the important &lt;em>as a Service&lt;/em> components and we go through several
different definitions of cloud computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Gartner&amp;rsquo;s Technology Landscape includes hype cycle and priority matrix
and covers clouds and Big Data. Two simple examples of the value of
clouds for enterprise applications are given with a review of different
views as to nature of Cloud Computing. This IaaS (Infrastructure as a
Service) discussion is followed by PaaS and SaaS (Platform and Software
as a Service). Features in Grid and cloud computing and data are
treated. We summarize the 21 layers and almost 300 software packages in
the HPC-ABDS Software Stack explaining how they are used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cloud (Data Center) Architectures with physical setup, Green Computing
issues and software models are discussed followed by the Cloud Industry
stakeholders with a 2014 Gartner analysis of Cloud computing providers.
This is followed by applications on the cloud including data intensive
problems, comparison with high performance computing, science clouds and
the Internet of Things. Remarks on Security, Fault Tolerance and
Synchronicity issues in cloud follow. We describe the way users and data
interact with a cloud system. The Big Data Processing from an
application perspective with commercial examples including eBay
concludes section after a discussion of data system architectures.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="decomposition">Decomposition&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We describe why parallel computing is essential with Big Data and
distinguishes parallelism over users to that over the data in problem.
The general ideas behind data decomposition are given followed by a few
often whimsical examples dreamed up 30 years ago in the early heady days
of parallel computing. These include scientific simulations, defense
outside missile attack and computer chess. The basic problem of parallel
computing &amp;ndash; efficient coordination of separate tasks processing
different data parts &amp;ndash; is described with MPI and MapReduce as two
approaches. The challenges of data decomposition in irregular problems
is noted.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="parallel-computing-in-society">Parallel Computing in Society&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This lesson from the past notes that one can view society as an approach
to parallel linkage of people. The largest example given is that of the
construction of a long wall such as that (Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall) between
England and Scotland. Different approaches to parallelism are given with
formulae for the speed up and efficiency. The concepts of grain size
(size of problem tackled by an individual processor) and coordination
overhead are exemplified. This example also illustrates Amdahl&amp;rsquo;s law and
the relation between data and processor topology. The lesson concludes
with other examples from nature including collections of neurons (the
brain) and ants.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This lesson returns to Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall and uses it to illustrate advanced
issues in parallel computing. First We describe the basic SPMD &amp;ndash; Single
Program Multiple Data &amp;ndash; model. Then irregular but homogeneous and
heterogeneous problems are discussed. Static and dynamic load balancing
is needed. Inner parallelism (as in vector instruction or the multiple
fingers of masons) and outer parallelism (typical data parallelism) are
demonstrated. Parallel I/O for Hadrian&amp;rsquo;s wall is followed by a slide
summarizing this quaint comparison between Big data parallelism and the
construction of a large wall.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="what-is-cloud-computing-introduction">What is Cloud Computing: Introduction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Cloud Computing is introduced with an operational definition involving
virtualization and efficient large data centers that can rent computers
in an elastic fashion. The role of services is essential &amp;ndash; it underlies
capabilities being offered in the cloud. The four basic aaS&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ndash;
Software (SaaS), Platform (Paas), Infrastructure (IaaS) and Network
(NaaS) &amp;ndash; are introduced with Research aaS and other capabilities (for
example Sensors aaS are discussed later) being built on top of these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This lesson gives Gartner&amp;rsquo;s projections around futures of cloud and Big
data. We start with a review of hype charts and then go into detailed
Gartner analyses of the Cloud and Big data areas. Big data itself is at
the top of the hype and by definition predictions of doom are emerging.
Before too much excitement sets in, note that spinach is above clouds
and Big data in Google trends.&lt;/p>

physical setup, Green Computing issues and software models. We summarize
a 2014 Gartner analysis of Cloud computing providers. This is followed
by applications on the cloud including data intensive problems,
comparison with high performance computing, science clouds and the
Internet of Things. Remarks on Security, Fault Tolerance and
Synchronicity issues in cloud follow.&lt;/p>

and why clouds are the data center of the future are followed by
pictures and discussions of several data centers from Microsoft (mainly)
and Google. The role of containers is stressed as part of modular data
centers that trade scalability for fault tolerance. Sizes of cloud
centers and supercomputers are discussed as is &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; computing.&lt;/p>

computing is especially sensitive to faults as a fault in one task will
impact all other tasks in the parallel job.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recommender systems operate under the hood of such widely recognized
sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and Netflix where everything is a
recommendation. This involves a symbiotic relationship between vendor
and buyer whereby the buyer provides the vendor with information about
their preferences, while the vendor then offers recommendations tailored
to match their needs. Kaggle competitions h improve the success of the
Netflix and other recommender systems. Attention is paid to models that
are used to compare how changes to the systems affect their overall
performance. It is interesting that the humble ranking has become such a
dominant driver of the world&amp;rsquo;s economy. More examples of recommender
systems are given from Google News, Retail stores and in depth Yahoo!
covering the multi-faceted criteria used in deciding recommendations on
web sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The formulation of recommendations in terms of points in a space or bag
is given where bags of item properties, user properties, rankings and
users are useful. Detail is given on basic principles behind recommender
systems: user-based collaborative filtering, which uses similarities in
user rankings to predict their interests, and the Pearson correlation,
used to statistically quantify correlations between users viewed as
points in a space of items. Items are viewed as points in a space of
users in item-based collaborative filtering. The Cosine Similarity is
introduced, the difference between implicit and explicit ratings and the
k Nearest Neighbors algorithm. General features like the curse of
dimensionality in high dimensions are discussed. A simple Python k
Nearest Neighbor code and its application to an artificial data set in 3
dimensions is given. Results are visualized in Matplotlib in 2D and with
Plotviz in 3D. The concept of a training and a testing set are
introduced with training set pre labeled. Recommender system are used to
discuss clustering with k-means based clustering methods used and their
results examined in Plotviz. The original labelling is compared to
clustering results and extension to 28 clusters given. General issues in
clustering are discussed including local optima, the use of annealing to
avoid this and value of heuristic algorithms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="s-recommender">Recommender Systems&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We introduce Recommender systems as an optimization technology used in a
variety of applications and contexts online. They operate in the
background of such widely recognized sites as Amazon, eBay, Monster and
Netflix where everything is a recommendation. This involves a symbiotic
relationship between vendor and buyer whereby the buyer provides the
vendor with information about their preferences, while the vendor then
offers recommendations tailored to match their needs, to the benefit of
both.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There follows an exploration of the Kaggle competition site, other
recommender systems and Netflix, as well as competitions held to improve
the success of the Netflix recommender system. Finally attention is paid
to models that are used to compare how changes to the systems affect
their overall performance. It is interesting how the humble ranking has
become such a dominant driver of the world&amp;rsquo;s economy.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="recommender-systems-as-an-optimization-problem">Recommender Systems as an Optimization Problem&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We define a set of general recommender systems as matching of items to
people or perhaps collections of items to collections of people where
items can be other people, products in a store, movies, jobs, events,
web pages etc. We present this as &amp;ldquo;yet another optimization problem&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We give a general discussion of recommender systems and point out that
they are particularly valuable in long tail of tems (to be recommended)
that are not commonly known. We pose them as a rating system and relate
them to information retrieval rating systems. We can contrast
recommender systems based on user profile and context; the most familiar
collaborative filtering of others ranking; item properties; knowledge
and hybrid cases mixing some or all of these.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We summarize some interesting points from a tutorial from Netflix for
whom &lt;em>everything is a recommendation&lt;/em>. Rankings are given in multiple
categories and categories that reflect user interests are especially
important. Criteria used include explicit user preferences, implicit
based on ratings and hybrid methods as well as freshness and diversity.
Netflix tries to explain the rationale of its recommendations. We give
some data on Netflix operations and some methods used in its recommender
systems. We describe the famous Netflix Kaggle competition to improve
its rating system. The analogy to maximizing click through rate is given
and the objectives of optimization are given.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Next we go through Netflix&amp;rsquo;s methodology in letting data speak for
itself in optimizing the recommender engine. An example iis given on
choosing self produced movies. A/B testing is discussed with examples
showing how testing does allow optimizing of sophisticated criteria.
This lesson is concluded by comments on Netflix technology and the full
spectrum of issues that are involved including user interface, data, AB
testing, systems and architectures. We comment on optimizing for a
household rather than optimizing for individuals in household.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We describe in greatest detail the methods used to optimize Yahoo web
sites. There are two lessons discussing general approach and a third
lesson examines a particular personalized Yahoo page with its different
components. We point out the different criteria that must be blended in
making decisions; these criteria include analysis of what user does
after a particular page is clicked; is the user satisfied and cannot
that we quantified by purchase decisions etc. We need to choose
Articles, ads, modules, movies, users, updates, etc to optimize metrics
such as relevance score, CTR, revenue, engagement.These lesson stress
that if though we have big data, the recommender data is sparse. We
discuss the approach that involves both batch (offline) and on-line
(real time) components.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Collaborative filtering is a core approach to recommender systems. There
is user-based and item-based collaborative filtering and here we discuss
the user-based case. Here similarities in user rankings allow one to
predict their interests, and typically this quantified by the Pearson
correlation, used to statistically quantify correlations between users.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We move on to item-based collaborative filtering where items are viewed

&lt;h3 id="item-based-collaborative-filtering">Item-based Collaborative Filtering&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We covered user-based collaborative filtering in the previous unit. Here
we start by discussing memory-based real time and model based offline
(batch) approaches. Now we look at item-based collaborative filtering
where items are viewed in the space of users and the cosine measure is
used to quantify distances. WE discuss optimizations and how batch
processing can help. We discuss different Likert ranking scales and
issues with new items that do not have a significant number of rankings.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We define the k Nearest Neighbor algorithms and present the Python

there would be faster solution methods.&lt;/p>

&lt;h4 id="recommender-systems---k-neighbors">Recommender Systems - K-Neighbors&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Next we provide some sample Python code for the k Nearest Neighbor and its application to
an artificial data set in 3 dimensions. Results are visualized in
Matplotlib in 2D and with Plotviz in 3D. The concept of training and
testing sets are introduced with training set pre-labelled.
This lesson is adapted from the Python k Nearest Neighbor code found on the
web associated with a book by Harrington on Machine Learning [??]. There are
two data sets. First we consider a set of 4 2D vectors divided into two
categories (clusters) and use k=3 Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify
3 test points. Second we consider a 3D dataset that has already been
classified and show how to normalize. In this lesson we just use
Matplotlib to give 2D plots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lesson goes through an example of using k NN classification
algorithm by dividing dataset into 2 subsets. One is training set with
initial classification; the other is test point to be classified by k=3
NN using training set. The code records fraction of points with a
different classification from that input. One can experiment with
different sizes of the two subsets. The Python implementation of
algorithm is analyzed in detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="plotviz">Plotviz&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The clustering methods are used and their results examined in

and value of heuristic algorithms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This section starts by discussing general aspects of Big Data and Health
including data sizes, different areas including genomics, EBI, radiology
and the Quantified Self movement. We review current state of health care
and trends associated with it including increased use of Telemedicine.
We summarize an industry survey by GE and Accenture and an impressive
exemplar Cloud-based medicine system from Potsdam. We give some details
of big data in medicine. Some remarks on Cloud computing and Health
focus on security and privacy issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We survey an April 2013 McKinsey report on the Big Data revolution in US
health care; a Microsoft report in this area and a European Union report
on how Big Data will allow patient centered care in the future. Examples
are given of the Internet of Things, which will have great impact on
health including wearables. A study looks at 4 scenarios for healthcare
in 2032. Two are positive, one middle of the road and one negative. The
final topic is Genomics, Proteomics and Information Visualization.&lt;/p>

provide the leadership required for the associated cultural
transformation; Companies must develop a range of big data capabilities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A study of an Azure application with an Excel frontend and a cloud BLAST
backend starts this lesson. This is followed by a big data analysis of
personal genomics and an analysis of a typical DNA sequencing analytics
pipeline. The Protein Sequence Universe is defined and used to motivate
Multi dimensional Scaling MDS. Sammon&amp;rsquo;s method is defined and its use
illustrated by a metagenomics example. Subtleties in use of MDS include
a monotonic mapping of the dissimilarity function. The application to
the COG Proteomics dataset is discussed. We note that the MDS approach
is related to the well known chisq method and some aspects of nonlinear
minimization of chisq (Least Squares) are discussed.&lt;/p>

(6:56)&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next we continue the discussion of the COG Protein Universe introduced
in the last lesson. It is shown how Proteomics clusters are clearly seen
in the Universe browser. This motivates a side remark on different
clustering methods applied to metagenomics. Then we discuss the
Generative Topographic Map GTM method that can be used in dimension
reduction when original data is in a metric space and is in this case
faster than MDS as GTM computational complexity scales like N not N
squared as seen in MDS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Examples are given of GTM including an application to topic models in
Information Retrieval. Indiana University has developed a deterministic
annealing improvement of GTM. 3 separate clusterings are projected for
visualization and show very different structure emphasizing the
importance of visualizing results of data analytics. The final slide
shows an application of MDS to generate and visualize phylogenetic
trees.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>What is Big Data, Data Analytics and X-Informatics?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start with X-Informatics and its rallying cry. The growing number of
jobs in data science is highlighted. The first unit offers a look at the
phenomenon described as the Data Deluge starting with its broad
features. Data science and the famous DIKW (Data to Information to
Knowledge to Wisdom) pipeline are covered. Then more detail is given on
the flood of data from Internet and Industry applications with eBay and
General Electric discussed in most detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next unit, we continue the discussion of the data deluge with a
focus on scientific research. He takes a first peek at data from the
Large Hadron Collider considered later as physics Informatics and gives
some biology examples. He discusses the implication of data for the
scientific method which is changing with the data-intensive methodology
joining observation, theory and simulation as basic methods. Two broad
classes of data are the long tail of sciences: many users with
individually modest data adding up to a lot; and a myriad of Internet
connected devices &amp;ndash; the Internet of Things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We give an initial technical overview of cloud computing as pioneered by
companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft with new centers holding up
to a million servers. The benefits of Clouds in terms of power
consumption and the environment are also touched upon, followed by a
list of the most critical features of Cloud computing with a comparison
to supercomputing. Features of the data deluge are discussed with a
salutary example where more data did better than more thought. Then
comes Data science and one part of it ~~ data analytics ~~ the large
algorithms that crunch the big data to give big wisdom. There are many
ways to describe data science and several are discussed to give a good
composite picture of this emerging field.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This discusses trends that are driven by and accompany Big data. We give
some key terms including data, information, knowledge, wisdom, data
analytics and data science. We discuss how clouds running Data Analytics
Collaboratively processing Big Data can solve problems in X-Informatics.
We list many values of X you can defined in various activities across
the world.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="jobs">Jobs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Big data is especially important as there are some many related jobs. We
illustrate this for both cloud computing and data science from reports
by Microsoft and the McKinsey institute respectively. We show a plot
from LinkedIn showing rapid increase in the number of data science and
analytics jobs as a function of time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We look at some broad features of the data deluge starting with the size
of data in various areas especially in science research. We give
examples from real world of the importance of big data and illustrate
how it is integrated into an enterprise IT architecture. We give some
views as to what characterizes Big data and why data science is a
science that is needed to interpret all the data.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="data-science-process">Data Science: Process&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We stress the DIKW pipeline: Data becomes information that becomes
knowledge and then wisdom, policy and decisions. This pipeline is
illustrated with Google maps and we show how complex the ecosystem of
data, transformations (filters) and its derived forms is.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>He discusses features of the data deluge with a salutary example where
more data did better than more thought. He introduces data science and
one part of it ~~ data analytics ~~ the large algorithms that crunch
the big data to give big wisdom. There are many ways to describe data
science and several are discussed to give a good composite picture of
this emerging field.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This section starts by describing the LHC accelerator at CERN and
evidence found by the experiments suggesting existence of a Higgs Boson.
The huge number of authors on a paper, remarks on histograms and Feynman
diagrams is followed by an accelerator picture gallery. The next unit is
devoted to Python experiments looking at histograms of Higgs Boson
production with various forms of shape of signal and various background
and with various event totals. Then random variables and some simple
principles of statistics are introduced with explanation as to why they
are relevant to Physics counting experiments. The unit introduces
Gaussian (normal) distributions and explains why they seen so often in
natural phenomena. Several Python illustrations are given. Random
Numbers with their Generators and Seeds lead to a discussion of Binomial
and Poisson Distribution. Monte-Carlo and accept-reject methods. The
Central Limit Theorem concludes discussion.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We introduce Plotviz, a data visualization tool developed at Indiana
University to display 2 and 3 dimensional data. The motivation is that
the human eye is very good at pattern recognition and can &lt;em>see&lt;/em>
structure in data. Although most Big data is higher dimensional than 3,
all can be transformed by dimension reduction techniques to 3D. He gives
several examples to show how the software can be used and what kind of
data can be visualized. This includes individual plots and the
manipulation of multiple synchronized plots.Finally, he describes the
download and software dependency of Plotviz.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="motivation-and-introduction-to-use">Motivation and Introduction to use&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The motivation of Plotviz is that the human eye is very good at pattern
recognition and can &lt;em>see&lt;/em> structure in data. Although most Big data is
higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by dimension
reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like clustering
and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis. The motivations
shows some Cheminformatics examples. The use of Plotviz is started in
slide 4 with a discussion of input file which is either a simple text or
more features (like colors) can be specified in a rich XML syntax.
Plotviz deals with points and their classification (clustering). Next
the protein sequence browser in 3D shows the basic structure of Plotviz
interface. The next two slides explain the core 3D and 2D manipulations
respectively. Note all files used in examples are available to students.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Initially we start with a simple plot of 8 points &amp;ndash; the corners of a

dataset (coming from GTM dimension reduction) with significant
structure. This has .pviz and a .txt versions that are compared.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We use the K-means Python code in SciPy package to show real code for
clustering. After a simple example we generate 4 clusters of distinct
centers and various choice for sizes using Matplotlib tor visualization.
We show results can sometimes be incorrect and sometimes make different
choices among comparable solutions. We discuss the &lt;em>hill&lt;/em> between
different solutions and rationale for running K-means many times and
choosing best answer. Then we introduce MapReduce with the basic
architecture and a homely example. The discussion of advanced topics
includes an extension to Iterative MapReduce from Indiana University
called Twister and a generalized Map Collective model. Some measurements
of parallel performance are given. The SciPy K-means code is modified to
support a MapReduce execution style. This illustrates the key ideas of
mappers and reducers. With appropriate runtime this code would run in
parallel but here the &lt;em>parallel&lt;/em> maps run sequentially. This simple 2
map version can be generalized to scalable parallelism. Python is used
to Calculate PageRank from Web Linkage Matrix showing several different
formulations of the basic matrix equations to finding leading
eigenvector. The unit is concluded by a calculation of PageRank for
general web pages by extracting the secret from Google.&lt;/p>

officially sets of weights and heights to be clustered to find T-shirt
sizes. We run through Python code with Matplotlib displays to divide
into 2-5 clusters. Then we discuss Python to generate 4 clusters of
varying sizes and centered at corners of a square in two dimensions. We
formally give the K means algorithm better than before and make
definition consistent with code in SciPy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="analysis-of-4-artificial-clusters">Analysis of 4 Artificial Clusters&lt;/h3>

&lt;em>large&lt;/em> and &lt;em>very large&lt;/em>. We emphasize the SciPy always does 20
independent K means and takes the best result &amp;ndash; an approach to avoiding
local minima. We allow this number of independent runs to be changed and
in particular set to 1 to generate more interesting erratic results. We
define changes in our new K means code that also has two measures of
quality allowed. The slides give many results of clustering into 2 4 6
and 8 clusters (there were only 4 real clusters). We show that the &lt;em>very
small&lt;/em> case has two very different solutions when clustered into two
clusters and use this to discuss functions with multiple minima and a
hill between them. The lesson has both discussion of already produced
results in slides and interactive use of Python for new runs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The changing global climate is suspected to have long-term effects on
much of the world&amp;rsquo;s inhabitants. Among the various effects, the rising
sea level will directly affect many people living in low-lying coastal
regions. While the ocean-s thermal expansion has been the dominant
contributor to rises in sea level, the potential contribution of
discharges from the polar ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica may
provide a more significant threat due to the unpredictable response to
the changing climate. The Radar-Informatics unit provides a glimpse in
the processes fueling global climate change and explains what methods
are used for ice data acquisitions and analysis.&lt;/p>

analytics are necessary for acquiring knowledge from large data. The
lesson details three mosaics of a changing Greenland ice sheet and
provides a concise overview to subsequent lessons by detailing
explaining how other remote sensing technologies, such as the radar, can
be used to sound the polar ice sheets and what we are doing with radar
images to extract knowledge to be incorporated into numerical models.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We start with the Internet of Things IoT giving examples like monitors
of machine operation, QR codes, surveillance cameras, scientific
sensors, drones and self driving cars and more generally transportation
systems. We give examples of robots and drones. We introduce the
Industrial Internet of Things IIoT and summarize surveys and
expectations Industry wide. We give examples from General Electric.
Sensor clouds control the many small distributed devices of IoT and
IIoT. More detail is given for radar data gathered by sensors;
ubiquitous or smart cities and homes including U-Korea; and finally the
smart electric grid.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sports sees significant growth in analytics with pervasive statistics
shifting to more sophisticated measures. We start with baseball as game
is built around segments dominated by individuals where detailed
(video/image) achievement measures including PITCHf/x and FIELDf/x are
moving field into big data arena. There are interesting relationships
between the economics of sports and big data analytics. We look at
Wearables and consumer sports/recreation. The importance of spatial
visualization is discussed. We look at other Sports: Soccer, Olympics,
NFL Football, Basketball, Tennis and Horse Racing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="basic-sabermetrics">Basic Sabermetrics&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This unit discusses baseball starting with the movie Moneyball and the
2002-2003 Oakland Athletics. Unlike sports like basketball and soccer,
most baseball action is built around individuals often interacting in
pairs. This is much easier to quantify than many player phenomena in
other sports. We discuss Performance-Dollar relationship including new
stadiums and media/advertising. We look at classic baseball averages and

&lt;p>This section starts with an overview of data mining and puts our study
of classification, clustering and exploration methods in context. We
examine the problem to be solved in web and text search and note the
relevance of history with libraries, catalogs and concordances. An
overview of web search is given describing the continued evolution of
search engines and the relation to the field of Information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The importance of recall, precision and diversity is discussed. The
important Bag of Words model is introduced and both Boolean queries and
the more general fuzzy indices. The important vector space model and
revisiting the Cosine Similarity as a distance in this bag follows. The
basic TF-IDF approach is dis cussed. Relevance is discussed with a
probabilistic model while the distinction between Bayesian and frequency
views of probability distribution completes this unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We start with an overview of the different steps (data analytics) in web
search and then goes key steps in detail starting with document
preparation. An inverted index is described and then how it is prepared
for web search. The Boolean and Vector Space approach to query
processing follow. This is followed by Link Structure Analysis including
Hubs, Authorities and PageRank. The application of PageRank ideas as
reputation outside web search is covered. The web graph structure,
crawling it and issues in web advertising and search follow. The use of
clustering and topic models completes the section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="web-search-and-text-mining">Web Search and Text Mining&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The unit starts with the web with its size, shape (coming from the
mutual linkage of pages by URL&amp;rsquo;s) and universal power laws for number of
pages with particular number of URL&amp;rsquo;s linking out or in to page.
Information retrieval is introduced and compared to web search. A
comparison is given between semantic searches as in databases and the
full text search that is base of Web search. The origin of web search in
libraries, catalogs and concordances is summarized. DIKW &amp;ndash; Data
Information Knowledge Wisdom &amp;ndash; model for web search is discussed. Then
features of documents, collections and the important Bag of Words
representation. Queries are presented in context of an Information
Retrieval architecture. The method of judging quality of results
including recall, precision and diversity is described. A time line for
evolution of search engines is given.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Boolean and Vector Space models for query including the cosine
similarity are introduced. Web Crawlers are discussed and then the steps
needed to analyze data from Web and produce a set of terms. Building and
accessing an inverted index is followed by the importance of term
specificity and how it is captured in TF-IDF. We note how frequencies
are converted into belief and relevance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>WebPlotViz is a browser based visualization tool developed at Indiana University.
This tool allows user to visualize 2D and 3D data points in the web browser.
WebPlotViz was developed as a succesor to the previous visualization tool PlotViz
which was a application which needed to be installed on your machine to be used.
You can find more information about PlotViz at the &lt;a href="plotviz.md">PlotViz Section&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The motivation of WebPlotViz is similar to PlotViz which is that the human eye
is very good at pattern recognition and can see structure in data. Although
most Big data is higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by
dimension reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like clustering
and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-use">How to use&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In order to use WebPlotViz you need to host the application as a server, this
can be done on you local machine or a application server. The source code for
WebPlotViz can be found at the git hub repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/DSC-SPIDAL/WebPViz">WebPlotViz git Repo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However there is a online version that is hosted on Indiana university servers
that you can access and use. The online version is available at &lt;a href="https://spidal-gw.dsc.soic.indiana.edu/">WebPlotViz&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to use the services of WebPlotViz you would need to first create a
simple account by providing your email and a password. Once the account is
created you can login and upload files to WebPlotViz to be visualized.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="uploading-files-to-webplotviz">Uploading files to WebPlotViz&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While WebPlotViz does accept several file formats as inputs, we will look at the
most simple and easy to use format that users can use. Files are uploaded as
&amp;ldquo;.txt&amp;rdquo; files with the following structure. Each value is separated by a space.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Index x_val y_val z_val cluster_id label&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Example file:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>0 0.155117377 0.011486086 -0.078151964 1 l1&lt;br>
1 0.148366394 0.010782429 -0.076370584 2 l2&lt;br>
2 0.170597667 -0.025115137 -0.082946074 2 l2&lt;br>
3 0.136063907 -0.006670781 -0.082583441 3 l3&lt;br>
4 0.158259943 0.015187686 -0.073592601 5 l5&lt;br>
5 0.162483279 0.014387166 -0.085987414 5 l5&lt;br>
6 0.138651632 0.013358333 -0.062633719 5 l5&lt;br>
7 0.168020213 0.010742307 -0.090281011 5 l5&lt;br>
8 0.15810229 0.007551404 -0.083311109 4 l4&lt;br>
9 0.146878082 0.003858649 -0.071298345 4 l4&lt;br>
10 0.151487542 0.011896318 -0.074281645 4 l4&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have the data file properly formatted you can upload the file through
the WebPlotViz GUI. Once you login to your account you should see a Green
&amp;ldquo;Upload&amp;rdquo; button on the top left corner. Once you press it you would see a
form that would allow you to choose the file, provide a description and select a
group to which the file needs to be categorized into. If you do not want to
assign a group you can simply use the default group which is picked by default&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have uploaded the file the file should appear in the list of plots
under the heading &amp;ldquo;Artifacts&amp;rdquo;. Then you can click on the name or the &amp;ldquo;View&amp;rdquo;
link to view the plot. Clicking on &amp;ldquo;View&amp;rdquo; will directly take you to the full
view of the plot while clicking on the name will show and summary of the plot
with a smaller view of the plot (Plot controls are not available in the smaller
view). You can view how the sample dataset looks like after uploading at the
following link. @fig:webpviz-11 shows a screen shot of the plot.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://spidal-gw.dsc.soic.indiana.edu/public/resultsets/2083856374">11 Points WebPlotViz plot&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../images/11_poitns_example.png" alt="11 Points Plot">{#fig:webpviz-11}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Users can apply colors to clusters manually or choose one of the color schemes
that are provided. All the controls for the clusters are made available once
your clock on the &amp;ldquo;Cluster List&amp;rdquo; button that is located on the bottom left
corner of the plot (Third button from the left). This will pop up a window that
will allow you to control all the settings of the clusters.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="features">Features&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>WebPlotViz has many features that allows the users to control and customize
the plots, Other than simple 2D/3D plots, WebPlotViz also supports time series
plots and Tree structures. The examples section will show case examples for each
of these. The data formats required for these plots are not covered here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="../../images/webplotviz_label.png" alt="WebPlotViz Features labeled">{#fig:webpviz-labled}&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the features are labeled in @fig:webpviz-labled. Please note that @fig:webpviz-labled
shows an time series plot so the controls for playback shown in the figure are not
available in single plots.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the features are descibed in the short video that is linked in the home
page of the hosted WebPlotViz site &lt;a href="https://spidal-gw.dsc.soic.indiana.edu/">WebPlotViz&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="examples">Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now we will take a look at a couple of examples that were visualized using
WebPlotViz.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fungi-gene-sequence-clustering-example">Fungi gene sequence clustering example&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The following example is a plot from clustering done on a set on fungi gene
